pandas-redshift
===============

**pandas-redshift** is a package to provide an interface between the Amazon Redshift Data API and pandas.

This package allows you to pass data between Amazon Redshift and``pandas.DataFrame``
objects without managing database connections. 

You can use this package for both private and commercial use while this project is
not officially supported by Amazon Web Services.

Now I am looking for contributors to enhance this package. If you are interested, feel free to pull
requests or reach out to me.
